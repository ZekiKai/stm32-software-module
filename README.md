# Useful STM32 Software Modules

### Introduction

The library collects the useful stm32 software modules I used before, so all of them can run in practice. 
Most of the codes are based on the official development board NUCLEO-F401RE, and the hardware configuration can be learned with the stm32cubeMX clearly.
Here's a list for modules contained and to be built:

* module for UM982
* module for MPU6050
* module for DRV8833

### Effect Visualization (to be add)



### How to work with it

If you are a beginner at the development with STM32, this is a helpful material for you with the simple code and easy method to use.
